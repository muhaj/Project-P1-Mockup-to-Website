# Project Description

Students where provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate that design 
in HTML and CSS as closely as possible.
We had to identify the various elements that we had to build in order to recreate the design by using
Twitter's Bootstrap framework.
Then we had to use the Project Coding Environment node to write our HTML and CSS files, until our code had a mismatch score of 8% or less.

# My result from the Project Coding Environment
